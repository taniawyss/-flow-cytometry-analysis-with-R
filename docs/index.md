Life scientists often use commercial software such as FlowJo or the OMIQ platform to analyze flow cytometry data. These tools are useful for initial and basic analysis, but do not allow for more advanced or flexible analyses, nor for the establishment of pipelines and reports. On the other hand, R is statistical software that allows for very flexible analysis, customizable pipeline creation and generation of reports.

The “Analysis of flow cytometry data with R” training that is proposed will focus on using R to analyze flow cytometry data. Flow cytometry data that can be analyzed with R includes classical multicolor flow cytometry, spectral flow cytometry, and CyTOF. This course will teach experts in flow cytometry how to run data analysis, develop pipelines and create reports using the open-source R software.

This course is proposed by the [Translational Data Science Facility](https://agora-cancer.ch/scientific-platforms/translational-data-science-facility/) of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Lausanne.

## Prerequisite

Participants should already have a general knowledge of flow cytometry. The course will focus on data analysis, but a brief introduction to flow cytometry will be given. To fully benefit from this course, participants should have basic knowledge of R, such as installing packages, running commands, importing and manipulating data within R, and basic plotting functions. These prerequisites can be obtained by attending the [First steps with R](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20231019_FSWIR) course organized by the SIB. Alternatively, participants can self-learn R using our [Introduction to R](https://taniawyss.github.io/flow-cytometry-analysis-with-R/introR/material/) page specifically designed for participants of the “Flow Cytometry analysis with R” course.
