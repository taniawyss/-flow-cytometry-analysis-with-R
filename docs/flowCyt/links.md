## A practical workflow for spectral flow cytometry data analysis with R

We found inspiration for this course in this publication

## The workflow presented in day 5 was inspired by Melsen et al, 2020

## Comparative analysis of dimension reduction methods for cytometry by time-of-flight data

From the abstract:

" Here, we benchmark the performances of 21 DR methods on 110 real and 425 synthetic CyTOF samples. We find that less well-known methods like SAUCIE, SQuaD-MDS, and scvis are the overall best performers. In particular, SAUCIE and scvis are well balanced, SQuaD-MDS excels at structure preservation, whereas UMAP has great downstream analysis performance. We also find that t-SNE (along with SQuad-MDS/t-SNE Hybrid) possesses the best local structure preservation. Nevertheless, there is a high level of complementarity between these tools, so the choice of method should depend on the underlying data structure and the analytical needs. "

## Orchestrating single-cell analysis with Bioconductor

Code mostly developed for single-cell RNA seq analysis, but some of the concepts explained apply to flow cytometry data analysis also, such as the singleCellExperiment object described in Chapter 4.

## R for Data Science Book

Book (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham (a very active R developer), Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund. The book makes heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse packages.

## R-charts

A site that has been created to be a reference for learning how to create charts in R as well as a place to look for inspiration. Code examples to create plots with base R, ggplot2. Color charts with R color name vs HEX equivalent.

## R Markdown

A useful resource is [RStudio's R Markdown tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

For tweaking your reports, such as chosing different output formats, or hiding or showing the code within the report, we recommend that you consult the R markdown documentation provided in this [Definite guide eBook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

Go further with the [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/).

## Cheatsheets

Several [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) available for different packages, eg R Markdown, ggplot2, RStudio,...
