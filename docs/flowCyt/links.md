## A practical workflow for spectral flow cytometry data analysis with R

We found inspiration for this course in this publication

## Orchestrating single-cell analysis with Bioconductor

Code mostly developed for single-cell RNA seq analysis, but some of the concepts explained apply to flow cytometry data analysis also, such as the singleCellExperiment object described in Chapter 4.

## R for Data Science Book

Book (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham (a very active R developer), Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund. The book makes heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse packages.

## R-charts

A site that has been created to be a reference for learning how to create charts in R as well as a place to look for inspiration. Code examples to create plots with base R, ggplot2. Color charts with R color name vs HEX equivalent.

## R Markdown

A useful resource is [RStudio's R Markdown tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

For tweaking your reports, such as chosing different output formats, or hiding or showing the code within the report, we recommend that you consult the R markdown documentation provided in this [Definite guide eBook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).


## Cheatsheets

Several [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) available for different packages, eg R Markdown, ggplot2, RStudio,...
