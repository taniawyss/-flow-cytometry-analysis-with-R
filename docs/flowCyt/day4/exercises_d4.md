## Reporting - R Markdown

If a data analysis project involves many steps and generation of various plots, one easy and very practical way to bundle and organize all steps of analysis together is to use R markdown files to generate PDF or html reports. These reports both display the R code used as well as the output generated, such as graphics, tables, statistical test results, ...

The difference between an R script and an R markdown file is that the code is organized within chunks in the R markdown file. In between the chunks, the user can write text that contains information about the analysis, package versions, links to websites, etc.

To create an R markdown file, go to File > New File > R markdown. Add a name.
This will create a new file that already has some example content. As you can see, the R code is organized in chunks highlighed in grey, with details written as free text in between the chunks. 
We can see that the pound sign (#) is used outside of the R code chunks. In this case, the # symbol does not correspond to a comment, but will indicate header levels for the titles and subtitles within your final document obtained after report generation.

Once the Rmd is ready, the report can be generated by hitting the "Knit" button at the top of the window.

The example Rmd generates the following html report (saved in the same folder as the Rmd file by default), that shows both the code and the resulting output:

You can find a short video that introduces some of the principles of R markdown on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZSDGGoQzQ), from the beginning up to minute 23:30. Starting at minute 23:30, this video also introduces ggplot2.

## Let's practice 11

To practice creating your own R markdown script, modify the one that is generated with the example content when you select File > New File > R Markdown.

Create a new Rmd file with the following options at the top (in the top YAML instructions within the 2 dash sequences "- - -")

* Title: «Let’s practice»
* Author: your name
* Select the «use current date when rendering object» option
* Default output format: HTML

We will perform a small flow cytometry analysis pipeline, but this time by creating a report.We will create an .Rmd file, and modify it to include the code for analysis and results of a small pipeline with dimensional reduction plots of the FR_FCM_Z3WR data.

Create a new .Rmd in which you will:

1) Modify the YAML metadata section to include a table of content with numbered sections and code folding buttons.

2) Write a paragraph with a level-1 header, that describes the content of the document.

3) Create code chunks that will run and print the output of the analysis listed below. Create a new code chunk for each plot. Make sure the plot is centered. Add a header (preceded by the # symbols outside of the code chunks) before each plot with some suggestive plot title.

  a)
  
  b)
  

4) Save the Rmd file, knit it to an html report, and admire it in your web-browser!

For tweaking your reports, such as choosing different output formats, or hiding or showing the code within the report, we recommend that you consult the R markdown documentation provided in this [Definite guide eBook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).
