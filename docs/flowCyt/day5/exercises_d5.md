## Example of workflow

Here we present an R markdown file that allows to perform a full flow cytometry data analysis workflow, including clustering, dimensional reduction and trajectory analysis.

This workflow was inspired by [Melsen et al, 2020](https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/205/3/864/60873/A-Comprehensive-Workflow-for-Applying-Single-Cell).
